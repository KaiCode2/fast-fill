# fast-fill — Live Mainnet Demo (CCTP, Base ⇄ Arbitrum)

This is a record of fast-fill running **on Ethereum mainnet L2s with real USDC**: the `CctpAdapter`
deployed on Base and Arbitrum, three real $1 transfers, settled through Circle's real attestation
service and `MessageTransmitterV2`. All amounts are in USDC base units (6 decimals; `1,000,000` = $1).

> Prototype, unaudited. Run with ~$5 of USDC for demonstration only.
>
> This historical demo predates `CctpExecutor`. It demonstrates the direct CCTP adapter settlement
> path that is still used when `mintFee == 0`. The executor-routed path (`mintFee > 0`) has since been
> deployed and smoke-tested; see [DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md#smoke-tests).

Owner = the EOA. Wired bidirectionally: domains (Base 6, Arbitrum 3), remote adapters, and per-chain
USDC (`remoteUsdc`).

## Runs 1 & 2 — baseline path (no relayer)

A $1 transfer Base→Arbitrum with **no optimistic fill**: the recipient simply receives the funds when
the CCTP message settles. Each delivered **999,870** (the 130-unit haircut is Circle's 1.3 bps
fast-transfer fee). These also seeded USDC onto Arbitrum to use as relayer liquidity for Run 3.

## Run 3 — optimistic fill (the headline)

A $1 transfer Base→Arbitrum to a **fresh recipient** `0xb959…bE53`, with a user-chosen premium that
caps at the adapter's 0.5%. The relayer fronts the funds on Arbitrum **before** the bridge settles,
then is reimbursed when it does.

orderId `0x5711e377…8286af`; final record `filler = EOA, status = Settled`.

### Outcome

| Party | Result |
|---|---|
| Recipient `0xb959…bE53` | **994,871** total — of which **994,801 arrived at fill time**, before the bridge settled |
| Relayer (EOA) | net **+4,999** (~$0.005) — the 0.5% premium earned for fronting capital over the bridge-latency window |
| Premium | 4,999 / 999,800 ≈ **0.5%** (the adapter `maxFeeRate` cap) |

The recipient got their money in seconds instead of waiting for CCTP, for a sub-cent premium; the
relayer earned that premium. And Runs 1–2 show the fallback: if nobody fills, the recipient just
gets the funds when CCTP settles, at no premium.

## How it was reproduced

> Note: this run predates the config-registry refactor and the CCTP Executor, so the deploy/wire steps
> below reflect the original per-instance setters. The current flow deploys one immutable
> `FastFillConfig` (CREATE2), then `CctpExecutor`, then the CCTP adapter with the executor address
> baked in — see [README → Deploy](README.md#deploy). The direct `mintFee == 0` fill/attest/settle
> mechanics are unchanged.

1. **Deploy** `CctpAdapter` on each chain (`forge create`, constructor: owner, maxFeeRate,
   `TokenMessengerV2`, `MessageTransmitterV2`, USDC).
2. **Wire** each: `setDomain`, `setRemoteAdapter`, `setRemoteUsdc` (addresses in
   [`script/config/Addresses.sol`](script/config/Addresses.sol)).
3. **Initiate** on the source: approve the adapter, then `initiateCCTP(dstChainId, recipient,
   amount, maxFee, mintFee, minFinalityThreshold, deliveryWindow, discountRate, baseFee, exec)` —
   `mintFee = 0` uses the direct `settle` path shown here; `mintFee > 0` routes settlement through
   `CctpExecutor.execute`. `minFinalityThreshold` is 1000 (fast) or 2000 (finalized);
   `deliveryWindow` is relative seconds; `baseFee` is the flat optimistic-fill fee (0 for none).
   (This historical run predated the relative-window + base-fee + destination-execution additions.)
4. **(optional) Fill** on the destination before settlement: relayer approves the adapter and calls
   `fill(order)`.
5. **Attest:** poll Circle's API
   `https://iris-api.circle.com/v2/messages/{srcDomain}?transactionHash={burnTx}` until
   `status == complete`.
6. **Settle** on the destination, direct path: `settle(message, attestation)` (wraps the real
   `receiveMessage`). Executor-routed orders instead call `CctpExecutor.execute(message, attestation)`.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the contracts work, and
[test/fork/CctpForkE2E.t.sol](test/fork/CctpForkE2E.t.sol) for the fork-based dry-run that validated
the source + message parsing against the real CCTP contracts before any funds were spent.

## Additional live coverage

The **CctpExecutor-routed CCTP path** has now been demonstrated with live USDC for both unfilled and
optimistically filled orders; see [DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md#smoke-tests). The **OFT (LayerZero)**
path is proven in the local + mock harness and is wired the same way, but a live OFT demo additionally
requires deploying a demo OFT on both chains and configuring the LayerZero peers + DVN/executor security
stack. Tracked as follow-up work.
